      "content": "Maintaining fair competition in international trade is essential for ensuring the benefits of free trade. However, some companies or countries attempt to gain competitive advantages through unfair practices that distort markets. To address these unfair trade practices, the World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes two key trade remedy measures: anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties. While these measures may appear similar on the surface, they target different practices and operate under distinct principles.",
